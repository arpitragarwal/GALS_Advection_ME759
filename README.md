What the project does
=====================

- Advection of a two-phase flow
- High-order accurate treatment of the interface with the Gradient Augmented
  LevelSet (GALS) method
- Works for a 2D domain

Why this project is useful
==========================

- Interface tracking is challenging in complex flow phenomena, this is tool for
  accurately doing that

How users can get started with the project
==========================================

- `GALS_Advection.cpp' has the main function
- This is compiled with the other *.h files
- Problem setup is done inside `GALS_Advection.cpp' and `initialization.h' files
